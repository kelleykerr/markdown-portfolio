## Step 1: Create a Task List

A task list creates checkboxes for people with access <sup>[:book:](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/#collaborator)</sup>in a repository to check off. They're very useful for tracking issues and pull requests.

If you include a task list in the body of an issue or pull request, you'll see a progress indicator in your issue list. 

Watch out! The syntax for task lists is very specific. Be sure to include the spaces where required, or else they won't render.
